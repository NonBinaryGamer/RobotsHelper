**[Play and rate the game on Itch!](https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam-4/rate/1663042)**

## Jam notes & disclaimers

- This requires playing on at least 1280x720p, recommended 1920x1080p
- This game is incomplete, I've bitten off more than I can so I ended up with just one basic level
- This game has a lot of bugs, the computer frequently gets stuck on the edges of the scenery, if that happens you can use the other bug that the piece you are moving still collides with the robot to "push" it onto a better path. As far as I'm aware while there are "inconvenient" bugs, nothing should prevent anyone from completing the game, I welcome any bug reports, but due to the rules of the jam, I will not be able to fix them until after the rating period.
- The game also lacks any sound effects or music, unfortunately.

## Story

Your old computer has come alive thanks to AI! Rolling on an old monitor cart with some car batteries strapped in it is on an adventure to explore the world now. Only one small issue, it is not able to travel over grass or climb up cliffs, yet. So you have to help it! Build platforms and ramps to help it find all the golden CDs so it can learn more about the world, who knows what it will do once it knows more?

## Controls/tutorial

Use your mouse to click on the platform types (on the right edge of the screen), they will be "attached" to your mouse as long as you hover over the map area.

Right-click to rotate the object you are holding by 90Â°

Left click to place the object in the current position (be careful, there is no way to move the objects after the fact!)

Click on the "GO" button in the bottom left of the screen to tell your robot to start, it will try to reach all  CDs, starting with the closest ones first.

There is no menu/setting/pause/restart screen.

## Other Information

Engine: Unity

Code, Textures, Models and Game design were all done by me during the duration of this jam. This was my 3rd ever jam, 2nd time in unity and 1st time I went for a 3D game.
